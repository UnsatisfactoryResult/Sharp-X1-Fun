The X1 Turbo was released in October of 1984 in three configurations and 2 colors.

CZ-850C - No floppy drives, built in data recorder (cassette tape drive)
CZ-851C - single 5 1/4" floppy drive
CZ-852C - dual 5 1/4" floppy drives

Following the model number was either a "B" for black, or an "R" for red.

The front panel is plastic, but the rest of the chassis is all metal. The floppy drives themselves have a solid metal chassis and could be wielded as weapons, making the dual floppy units quite heavy.

These models do have a 2.4V battery of misery that resides on the main board. Before attempting to power one of these units up for the first time, it is wise to at least inspect/recap the power supply and remove/replace the battery.

These units are like a puzzle to disassemble, but it's not too bad. To fully break down the unit for inspection go in this order:

1 - remove top cover
2 - remove rear panel
3 - unplug ribbon and power cables from the floppy drives
4 - remove the large screws on the front support, but leave the small screws holding the drives (3 each)
5 - slide the front support bar back and tilt up to remove it and both floppy drives as a unit
6 - remove the rear support bar
7 - remove the cables at the front of the telopper board and slide the board out
8 - follow the floppy ribbon cable to the front of the main board, unplug it, and free it from the wire management clips
9 - slide the floppy expansion board out (it may be easier to remove the expansion carrier at the same time)
10 - remove the single screw holding the expansion carrier to the sub board below
11 - lift the expansion carrier straight up, you may need to GENTLY rock the board to board connector back and forth a bit
12 - remove the rest of the plugs and harnesses, all of the connectors should be marked so it's easy to put back together
13 - there are 2 very short ribbon cables at the side and front connecting the main and sub board together, be very careful removing them as there is no slack
14 - remove the rest of the screws holding the sub board down
15 - carefully release the clips holding the sub board down and pull it out
16 - finally the main board is visible. Remove any remaining wire harnesses
17 - remove the rest of the screws holding the main board down
18 - gently release all the plastic clip holding the board down and pull it out (you may need to remove the front lower support first)
19 - remove the screws holding the front lower support in and remove it
20 - remove any remaining wire harnesses coming from the power supply and slide it out the back
21 - remove the wires from the speaker being sure to keep track of which terminal the black dotted wire goes to
22 - remove the 4 screws holding the front panel brackets to the side of the chassis and slide it off
23 - you can now remove the power switch board, the led board, the front panel control board, and the front keyboard input board from the front panel
24 - enjoy your big pile of mess

It actually comes apart very easily, and everything is marked well. The only tricky part is the floppy expansion board since the cable runs all the way to the front. The screws are very easy to keep track of. There are 2 different length screws holding in the main and sub boards, so that's the only place you need to pay close attention to.
