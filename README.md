The X1 was Sharp's line of 8 bit computers, not to be confused with the MZ series, Sharp's line of 8 bit computers. The MZ series was created by Sharp's computer division, and the X1 was created by the TV division. Most X1s had a number of neat TV features. The first model was released in 1984 and the final released in 1988. In 1987 the X68000 was released, and the X1 wasn't long for the world anymore.

There are 3 main versions of the X1, the original X1, the X1 Turbo, and the X1 Turbo Z. The Turbo Z models offered the best graphics and audio with expanded color and FM audio built in. While the Turbo Z models are sought after for being the most compatible and powerful, there is one model that is also quite sought after and special, the X1 Twin.

The X1 Twin lacked some of the features of the others. It was only available with 1 floppy drive, though upgradable to 2. There is no Telopper feature, something pretty unique to the X1s in general. It did however have a PC Engine built into it. Supposedly NEC owned the PC Engine name, so it was branded HE System. This was a joint venture between Sharp and Hudson after all. I'll be posting more about the X1 Twin in its own section.

Software was available on cassette as well as 5 1/4" floppy. No operating system was built in, just an IPL. If you want to load Basic, you need to load it from the drive each time. While this may sound cumbersome, programs were able to access resources that would otherwise be taken up if Basic was built in. 

Many games were released for the platform. A lot were ported to a miriad of systems in the day, but there are a few X1 exclusives floating around. I honestly haven't done a lot with the library yet as I'm still restoring hardware to get things up and running.
